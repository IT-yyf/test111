 
Given the following code... 

class Animal {     
void walk(){         
System.out.println("I am walking");     
} 
} 

 class Bird extends Animal {     
void fly() {         
System.out.println("I am flying");     
} 
void sing() {         
System.out.println("I am singing");     
} 
} 




public class Solution {     
public static void main(String[] args) {         
Bird bird = new Bird();         
bird.walk();         
bird.fly();         
bird.sing();     
} 
} 
 

1.Can you implement the sing() method for the bird? a. How did you unit test it?  b. How did you optimize the code for maintainability? (Ask yourself the same question for all following exercises)

 class Bird extends Animal {     
void fly() {         
System.out.println("I am flying");     
} 
void sing() {         
System.out.println("I am singing");     
} 
} 




2. 	Now, we have 2 special kinds of birds: the Duck and the Chicken... Can you implement them to make their own special sound? 
a. A duck says: “Quack, quack” 
b. A duck can swim 
c. A chicken says: “Cluck, cluck” 
d. A chicken cannot fly (assumption: its wings are clipped but ignore that)

 class duck1 extends bird { 
System.out.println("Quack, quack");    
}

 class duck2 extends bird
        void swim() {         
System.out.println("I am swiming");   
} 
      }

class chicken1 extends bird {     
System.out.println("Cluck, cluck");     
} 
 class chicken2 extends bird {     
System.out.println("I can't fly");     
} 




3. 	Now how would you model a rooster? 
a. A rooster says: “Cock-a-doodle-doo” 
b. How is the rooster related to the chicken? 
c. Can you think of other ways to model a rooster without using inheritance?

A.
class Rooster extends chicken1 {     
System.out.println("Cock-a-doodle-doo");     
} 

B.公鸡是鸡的子类，包含鸡的所有属性。

C.New 一个公鸡对象



4. 	Can you model a parrot? We are specifically interested in three parrots, one that lived in a house with dogs one in a house with cats, the other lived on a farm next to the rooster.  
a. A parrot living with dogs says: “Woof, woof” 
b. A parrot living with cats says: “Meow” 
c. A parrot living near the rooster says: “Cock-a-doodle-doo” 
d. How do you keep the parrot maintainable? What if we need another parrot lives near Duck? Or near a phone that rings frequently? 
 a.   
     Class Parrot1 extends bird {     
 void live() {         
System.out.println("living with dogs");   
} 
 void say() {         
System.out.println("Woof, woof");   
} 
} 

b.
    Class Parrot2 extends bird {     
 void live() {         
System.out.println("I am living with cats");   
} 
 void say() {         
System.out.println("Meow");   
} 

} 




c.
    Class PSarrot3 extends rooster {     
      
System.out.println("Cock-a-doodle-doo");   

} 

d.让一只鹦鹉继承鸭子的方法。






B. Model fish as well as other swimming animals 
 
1. In addition to the birds, can you model a fish? 
a. Fishes don’t sing 
b. Fishes don’t walk 
c. Fishes can swim 
 
class Fish {     
void swim(){         
System.out.println("I am swiming");     
} 

public class Solution {     
public static void main(String[] args) {         
Fish fish = new Fish();         
fish .swim();         
}
}

2. 	Can you specialize the fish as a Shark and as a Clownfish? 
a. Sharks are large and grey 
b. Clownfish are small and colourful (orange) 
c. Clownfish make jokes 
d. Sharks eat other fish  

Class Fish{
      String size;
      String color;
}
Fish shark = new Fish()
shark .size=”large”;
shark .color-”grey”;


Class SShark extends Fish{     

void eat() {         
System.out.println("I eat all the fish");     
} 
} 






Fish clownfish = new Fish()
shark .size=”small”;
shark .color=”orange”;

 class Clownfish extends Fish {   
  
void jokes() {         
System.out.println("I can make jokes");     
} 
} 




3.Dolphins are not exactly fish, yet, they are good swimmers a. Can you model a dolphin that swims without inheriting from a fish class? b. How do you avoid duplicating code or introducing unneeded overhead?

Class Dolphins{
System.out.println("I'm a good swimmer");

}



D. Model animals that change their behaviour over time 
 
1. 	Can you model a butterfly? 
a. A butterfly can fly 
b. A butterfly does not make a sound

Class Butterfly extends Animal {
      void fly() {         
System.out.println("I am flying");     
} 


}


2. 	Can you optimize your model to account for the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly? 
a. A caterpillar cannot fly 
b. A caterpillar can walk (crawl)

caterpillar extends Butterfly {
      void fly(){
            System.out.println("I can't fly"); 
}
void walk(){
            System.out.println("I can walk");
} 
}





E. Counting animals 
 
Suppose you have an array of animals, e.g.  
 Animal[] animals = new Animal[]{         
new Bird(),         
new Duck(),         
new Chicken(),         
new Rooster(),         
new Parrot(),        
new Fish(),         
new Shark(),         
new Clownfish(),         
new Dolhpin(),         
new Frog(),         
new Dog(),         
new Butterfly(),         
new Cat() 

};

Note: The above instantiation may be different if you chose to set up your object model differently… (hopefully you did) 
 
1. Can you share the code to count: 
a. how many of these animals can fly? 
b. how many of these animals can walk?
c. how many of these animals can sing? 
d. how many of these animals can swim? 
 

        List<animals > list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(fly);
        list.add(walk);
        list.add(sing);
list.add(swim);
  
        int sum =0;
        for (animals fly : list) {
            if (animals.fly().equals("fly")) {
                sum = sum +1;
            }
        }





BONUS 
 
If you still have time left, please consider the following: 
 
1.Can you add a second language (if you know a language other than English) Use the rooster as a PoC for demonstrating this. For example, this is how the Rooster sounds differently depending on language. Please add the rooster sound in your native tongue.
